# Lydia's Portfolio

## Description

This is Lydia's first portfolio. It's mainly built with HTML and CSS. The purpose of this design is to practice styling using CSS. The code is not the simpliest way, but it is a good way to solidify the language of CSS. The webpage will be updated with more of Lydia's works eventually.
Thanks for visiting!
